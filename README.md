# Assignment No. 2 – Supervised Learning

## Chosen Problem

Backpack Prediction Challenge (<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e2/data>)

## Theme

The second practical assignment of IART focuses on the application of **Supervised Learning** techniques in the context of classification problems. The goal is to develop and evaluate machine learning models capable of learning from labeled data to make accurate predictions regarding a specific target variable (or concept).

## Workflow

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze the dataset’s characteristics: class distribution, data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
   - Inform preprocessing steps such as handling missing data, encoding, normalization, and feature selection.

2. **Modeling:**
   - Implement and compare at least three supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Neural Networks, k-NN, SVM).
   - Assess model performance using metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and training/testing times.
   - Follow the complete ML pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, problem definition, model selection/tuning, training/testing, evaluation, and comparison.

3. **Documentation:**
   - Use tables and visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn) to illustrate model performance.
   - Submit code as a Jupyter Notebook for clarity and integration of code, visualizations, and explanations.

## Programming Language/Libraries

- **Python** (strongly recommended)
- **Pandas** – data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy/SciPy** – numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** – ML models and evaluation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** – visualization
- Other tools or libraries may be used with prior approval from the course instructors, provided they are well justified in terms of functionality or performance. In all cases, the code must be well-structured, clearly commented, and easily reproducible.

## Groups

- Students must carry out this assignment in groups of three. In exceptional cases, groups of two students may be allowed, but this should be justified and approved by the instructors.
- To ensure effective collaboration and facilitate logistical coordination, each group should consist of students from the same practical class. Groups composed of students from different classes are discouraged due to the additional difficulties in scheduling and monitoring progress.
- All group members must be present at the checkpoint session and the final presentation/demonstration. Active and balanced participation from all members is expected throughout the development of the assignment.

## Checkpoint

Each group must submit a brief progress presentation in PDF format (maximum 5 slides + title slide) via Moodle. This presentation will be discussed during class with the instructor to assess the current status of the project, validate the approach and provide guidance for its continuation.

The checkpoint presentation should include the following elements:

1. **Problem Definition** – Clear description of the supervised learning problem being addressed and the target variable(s).
2. **Related Work** – Summary of relevant studies, datasets, or codebases, with proper references (e.g., research articles, official documentation, GitHub repositories).
3. **Methodology** – Description of the tools, libraries, algorithms, and evaluation metrics selected for the assignment.
4. **Work Progress** – Brief report on the implementation carried out so far (e.g., data analysis, preprocessing, initial models).

The checkpoint is intended to validate the approach chosen by the group and ensure that the project is progressing in a well-structured and coherent manner. All team members must be present during the session to discuss the work with the instructor.

## Final Delivery

Each group must submit two files via Moodle:

1. **A presentation in PDF format** (maximum 10 slides) summarizing the work developed.
2. **The complete source code**, in a Jupyter Notebook format, including a well-documented README file with instructions on how to execute the program.

The final submission must include the following elements:

- A clear description of the problem addressed, including the definition of the target variable and dataset used.
- Details on data preprocessing, including any cleaning, encoding, normalization, or feature selection techniques applied.
- Description of the machine learning models implemented, including the algorithms chosen, their parameters, and justifications for their selection.
- Evaluation and comparison of models using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) and training/testing time.
- Visual elements such as tables, plots, and confusion matrices to support the comparison and analysis of results (preferably using Matplotlib or Seaborn).

Students should submit their code as a Jupyter Notebook, which is recommended for its clarity and integration of code, visualizations, and explanations.

Based on the final presentation, each group will give a **10-minute live demonstration** of their project, either during the practical class or in a special session scheduled by the instructors. All group members must participate in the presentation.
